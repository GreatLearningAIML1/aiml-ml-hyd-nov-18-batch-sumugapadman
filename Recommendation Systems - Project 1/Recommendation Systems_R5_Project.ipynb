    "Make new Product Recommendations\n",
    "Problem Statement -\n",
    "Build your own recommendation system for products on an e-commerce website like Amazon.com.\n",
    "Dataset - ​ Amazon Reviews data (http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "o The repository has several datasets. For this case study, please use the Electronics dataset.\n",
    "o The host page has several pointers to scripts and other examples that can help with parsing the datasets.\n",
    "o The data set consists of:\n",
    "● 7,824,482 Ratings (1-5) for Electronics products.\n",
    "● Other metadata about products. Please see the description of the fields available on the web page cited above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "o For convenience of future use, parse the raw data file (using Python, for example) and extract the following fields: 'product/productId' as prod_id, 'product/title' as prod_name, 'review/userId' as user id, 'review/score' as rating\n",
    "o Save these to a tab separated file. Name this file as product_ratings.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps -\n",
    "1. Read and explore the dataset. (Rename column, plot histograms, find data characteristics)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take subset of dataset to make it less sparse/more dense. (For example, keep the users only who has given 50 or more number of ratings )\n",
    "3. Split the data randomly into train and test dataset. (For example split it in 70/30 ratio)\n",
    "4. Build Popularity Recommender model.\n",
    "5. Build Collaborative Filtering model.\n",
    "6. Evaluate both the models. (Once the model is trained on the training data, it can be used to compute the error (RMSE) on predictions made on the test data.)\n",
    "7. Get top - K (K = 5) recommendations. Since our goal is to recommend new products to each user based on his/her habits,we will recommend 5 new products.\n",
    "8. Summarise your insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mark Distributions -\n",
    "Step - 1,2,3,8 - 5 marks each\n",
    "Step - 4,5,6,7 - 10 marks each"
