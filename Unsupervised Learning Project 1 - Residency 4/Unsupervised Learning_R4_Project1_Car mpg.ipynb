    "- EDA & Pre-processing (Make sure to remove all non-numeric entries from numeric columns) – 2.5 points\n",
    "- Use pair plot or scatter matrix to visualize how the different variables are related (Hint: The amount of Gaussian curves in the plot should give a visual identification of different clusters existing in the dataset) – 5 points\n",
    "- Use K Means or Hierarchical clustering to find out the optimal no of clusters in the data. Identify and separate the clusters (15 points)\n",
    "- Use linear regression model on different clusters separately and print the coefficients of the models individually (7.5 points)"
